## About this project
The Analysis was done using Microsoft Excel on the data "Employee Survey Response" from Maven Analytics. The project aims to analyze the response of employee and gain insights into their views on work expectations, Diversity in the organization, and Job Role Satisfaction.
### Data Preparation

The survey data was thoroughly cleaned and organized to remove any inconsistencies and missing values, ensuring the accuracy of the analysis.

For Example – The “Incomplete” Status was not included in the Analysis [a total of 103 responses were incomplete], The same questions containing different characters were identified and treated, removed duplicates, etc.

At last, I performed the analysis on a cleaned dataset of 14576 rows

### Key Findings

#### Question Analysis

Understanding Work Expectations: A majority of respondents agreed with the statement "I know what is expected of me at work."

Inclusivity and Diversity: The question regarding department inclusivity and support for a diverse workforce also received high agreement from respondents.

Having a Best Friend at Work: The question with the most disagreement among respondents was related to having a best friend at work, indicating a potential area for improvement.

Recognition for Good Work: Some respondents expressed the belief that their good work over the last seven days did not receive sufficient recognition.

#### Overall Job Satisfaction

The question "Overall I am Satisfied with my job" received the highest number of responses. Approximately 75.71% of respondents reported being satisfied with their work.

#### Department Satisfaction Analysis

The top three departments with the highest overall job satisfaction are:

Planning and Public Works

Prosecuting Attorney's Office

Finance and Performance Management

#### Job Role Satisfaction Analysis

Respondents from all job roles generally agreed that they were satisfied with their work. However, employees in the "Staff" category showed a higher level of disagreement regarding work satisfaction compared to other job roles.

### Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into employee satisfaction within the organization. It is clear that employees generally understand their job expectations and believe in the inclusivity of their departments. However, the challenge lies in fostering strong workplace relationships and recognizing employee contributions. The majority of employees express job satisfaction, with specific departments and job roles showing varying levels of contentment.

### Recommendations

Encourage team-building activities to foster closer workplace relationships.
Implement recognition and praise programs to acknowledge employees' good work.
Consider department-specific strategies for improving job satisfaction where needed.
Further, an honest conversation with employees can help the organization to exactly know what is lacking for employee satisfaction.
